# Patreon Discord Announcer (PDA)
PDA is an application that utilizes Discord as a notification platform to inform users of new and current posts from their favorite Patreon creators. Instead of navigating to multiple Patreon pages and checking each for new or current posts, PDA allows you to view all of your Patreon content in one channel. Our Bot commands make this even more simple allowing you to add/remove content creators at any time, change where you want your posts to be displayed or opt out entirely if you lose interest.

## Features
* Simple and efficient output from Patreon to Discord
* Solves Patreon's Captcha to avoid bot detection
* Utilizes JDA for seamless Discord Integration
* Reads and labels both public and private posts

## How to Run
* **Method 1: Invite our PDA Bot** - *Quick and simple*  
  * [Add PDA to your Discord server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=965002259689783296&scope=bot&permissions=68608)  
  * Use [Bot Commands](#bot-commands) listed below to get updates on your favorite content creators

* **Method 2: Use your own bot** - *Highly technical*  
    * Download the latest [PDA release](https://github.com/cis3296s22/patreon-discord-announcer/releases)  
    * Extract the downloaded zip in any directory  
    * Inside the directory containing the extracted PDA files, open config.json and replace **TOKEN**'s value **0** with your Discord Bot Token  
    * For help finding your Discord Bot Token or with any other part of creating/setting up your Discord Bot, view our [Discord Bot Wiki](https://github.com/cis3296s22/patreon-discord-announcer/wiki/Technical-Information)  
    * Once properly configured, open a terminal/console and navigate to the directory where the PDA binary is stored, from here run the command `java -jar  patreon-discord-announcer-x.x-jar-with-dependencies.jar`  
        ** *Ensure x.x is changed to the appropriate version number* ** 
    * Now you can use PDA and the [Bot Commands](#bot-commands) on your own Discord Server  
        ** *Note, when the terminal window is closed PDA will no longer update your channel* **
